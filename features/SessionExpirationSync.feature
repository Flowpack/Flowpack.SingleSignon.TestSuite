Feature: Global session expiration synchronization
  In order to have a consistent session experience on all instances
  As a user of an instance
  I want session expiration to be in sync for the server and all instances

  Scenario: Session expired on server, instance is expired
  Scenario: User is active on one instance, session is touched regularly on server
