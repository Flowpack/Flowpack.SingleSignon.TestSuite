Feature: Account switching on Single Sign-On server
  In order to provide multi-tenant functionality
  As a system integrator
  I want an easy way of switching between accounts on the server (impersonate)

  Scenario: New session with real account
  Scenario: New session with switched account
  Scenario: Switch account on existing session
  Scenario: Switch back account on existing session
